Thank you for downloading ! :)

Mipmap Visualization is a tool that make mipmap of texture visualized. 
The meaning of this can help us decide the proper size of texture we used in game. 

This package is different from unity built in mipmaps draw mode.
Unity built in mipmaps draw mode let you know if textures larger or smaller than necessary.
However this package will let you know the exact used mipmap level by color.

How to use ?
 => Just drag "MipmapVisualization.cs" to any game object in your scene.
 => Then drag "MipmapVisualization.mat" to "Example Material" slot on inspector.
 => Run demo scene then you will see the result.

All source code is in "MipmapVisualization.cs".
It is very easy to be modified based on your demand.

If you like it, please give me a 5 star on asset store. Thanks so much !
